How does the internet work?

    the internet works by connecting us all throught networks. data can be transfered between all things connected to it. we can
request data from servers. the computers can all comunicate with eachother. internet protocol is required to keep all the computers 
working together folowing the same regulations. when data is sent through the network it is split into small packets. the small packets are 
faster and if something gets lost from a small packet rather then a big block of data its easy to replace. when your searching the 
internet your just sending messages back and forth, requesting and recieving data.


what happens when you click a link?

    when you click on a link (short for hyperlink) on a webpage, you are requesting the computer load that page for you.
there are relative and absolute link. relative links load a page relative to the current website, and absolute links are required for
links that direct you out of the webpage you are already in. absolute links require the url contain the domain name since the current
page has no reference to find that page within its own data.
